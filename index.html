        <h2>About Me:</h2>
        <p>I am a passionate and versatile <b>graphic designer</b> and <b>Software
                developer</b> with over 5 years experience delivering creative and
            technical solutions that solve real-world problems. My work
            bridges the gap between fuctionality and aesthetics-from clean
            user interfaces and responsive websites to compeling visual brands
            and marketing materials.
            <br>
            <br>
            With a strong foundation in design thinking and software development,
            i specialize in creating experiences that are as beautiful as they
            are functional. Whether designing a visual identity or developing a
            full-stack application, I bring attention to detail, creativity, and a user-focused mindset to every
            project.
